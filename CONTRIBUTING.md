# Contributing to qdrant-mcp-hybrid-public

First of all, thanks for even considering contributing. You're already doing better than 99% of visitors.

## ðŸ§  What This Is

This repo is a TypeScript MCP server for Qdrant, with multi-client isolation, LM Studio integration, and enterprise-level document processing.  
If youâ€™re reading this, you probably know what youâ€™re doing â€” but just in case:

- All clients are separated (`{client}_catalog`, `{client}_chunks`)
- Local-first architecture (no cloud dependencies)
- Built for semantic search using BGE-M3 embeddings + Qwen3-8B summaries

## âœ… Ground Rules

- Be respectful. Donâ€™t be a jerk, not even in cleverly disguised sarcasm.
- Format your code. We use `prettier` and basic TypeScript linting.
- If youâ€™re adding a new dependency, explain why. If itâ€™s `"leftpad"`, go home.
